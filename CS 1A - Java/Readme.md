# CS 1A Java programs
# How to use the reviewer?
* Create a .txt file.
* Format the txt file like this (question-answer):

In which battle did Napoleon die?-his last one

Enumerate something-item 1, item 2, item 3, ... item N

* Make sure the question and answer are separated by whatever character is assigned to the variable "regex" (you can change to however you want the question and answer to be split), otherwise your answer won't be checked agaisnt the correct answer. And also, make sure the question and answer don't contain that character.
* The program handles case sensitivity, so ANSWER is the same as answer.
* Save the txt file.
* After that, if you're on a pc, just copy the address of that txt file and paste it to the "filename" variable as a string. If you're on mobile, make sure you save the txt file within the folder your Java IDE app or whatever is using to store your Java programs.
* Run the program.
* To hit the correct answer, make sure your answer is neither preceeded nor succeeded by a whitespace then hit enter.
* Sometimes, formatting is a mess. It has nothing to do with the program but the txt file itself. You have to make sure each q and a is in the same line. Below it is a blank line. Then another q and a.
